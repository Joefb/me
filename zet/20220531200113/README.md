# cmdprac Randomize Learning Array

**Problem**</br>
I would like to have an option to pick a random learning array. This
would be a easy way to drill random commands. It could be something like:
`cmdprac --rand`

**Solutions/Ideas**</br>
Maybe I could ls the dir, read each file and store them in an array and
use the function I made to randomize the questions of learning arrays.
This would choose a random learning array.

Another feature I could add is someway to track what learning arrays
have already been completed. That way you wont get the same learning
array multiple times. First Ill work on randomizing the learning arrays
before I work on the tracking feature.

    #cmdprac #bash #scripting #linux
