# Pre Owned IoT Devices Not Reset to Defaults

While walking through my local thrift store I saw pre owned routers.
I wondered if the previous owner or the thrift store would 
reset the device back to factory defaults. If not then I assumed personal
information would still be stored in the ROM. I picked up an old 
Linksys E1000 they had to test my hypothesis.

I gained root access to the device and sure enough the passwords from
the previous owner were still stored in the ROM along with other 
details about their network. 

This could lead to security issues. I was not surprised the previous
owner did not reset the device but I was very surprised the thrift store
who is a major chain did not a policy in place to reset the device while 
testing it.

This peaked my curiosity about other pre owned IoT devices. I have
picked up quite a few more and will do further testing.

If you donate or give away old IoT devices reset them!
