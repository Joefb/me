# cmdprac Piping Learning Array

**Idea to Remember**</br>
I just had the idea to have a piping learning array and I dont want to
forget it! I could use commands that are commonly piped together. Have
some easy pipe chains and some more complicated ones.

This would be a great way for people to learn common commands and how to
pipe them together.

    #cmdprac #bash #scripting #learning
