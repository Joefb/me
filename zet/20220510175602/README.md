# Dont get mad. Get busy.

I have been following along with the SKILSTAK boost by rwxrob. He
suggested a documentary called "The Internets Own Boy". That was an
amazing documentary! I had a wide range of emotions while watching it.
I was very upset and angry by the end of it.

During the Boost with rwxrob he said something that stuck with me. He
said "Dont get mad. Get busy" What this means to  me is to channel the
anger/passion/energy/love into learning so you can change the world
around you.  Knowledge is power and information should be freely
accessible to everyone. Education empowers people to change the world
around them. To better themselfs and the people around them.

I was very motivated by this documentary. Time to get busy!
