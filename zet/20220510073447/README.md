# Making my first zettel entry

This is the start of my zettel cast entrys. I really like the Zettelkasten Method and I think it will help me organize my chaotic brain.
Often times I have ideas or thoughts and think to myself "Oooo I need to remember that". Sometimes Ill write it down but most times I dont. Shame on me!
I will also be keeping a small note book with me so I can quickly write down ideas or thoughs so I can add them here at a later time.
Keeping my zettels in my reop will allow me to quickly search the slips and reflect on past thoughts and ideas that I have had. Slips are the body of the
of the zettel.

The format of my zettels will consist of a:
* Unique identifer
* Title in UNICODE from 25 to 50 chars 
* Body of about 25 to 30 lines
* Single level lists
* References and links to URLs at bottom
* Hashtags on last line with a 4 space indent
* Try to avoid subheadings. Just make a new zettle.

The unique identifer will be the year/month/day/hour/minute/second. The time will be in GMT format.

I will try to avoid "by the way" thoughts to keep the zettels from growing into a giant blob of madness.
