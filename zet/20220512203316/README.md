# Cheap devices to practice hardware hacking

Problem: Finding cheap IoT devices to practice on.

Solutions so far:
1. The local thrift stores. I have found tons of cheap IoT devices.
2. Friends and family. They usually have old devices laying around.
3. Co-workers. A few co-workers I've asked happily gave me old devices.
4. Yard sales. You can get them super cheap.
5. Local buy/sell groups on social media.

Thrift stores by far have been the best and are always recieving a
steady flow of donated devices.

I am not sure about buy/sell groups on social media sites but it seems
like an ok source. I try to stay away from social media.
