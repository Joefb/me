# Exercism Coding Challenges

I have decided to start working on daily exercism coding challenges. I
want to work various languages to help learn the syntax and a better
understanding of algos. Ill start with bash first since thats what Im
mostly doing at the moment.

### Learning Goals
1. Bash syntax
2. Go syntax
3. Python syntax
4. Pearl syntax
5. Practice algos
