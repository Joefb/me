# cmdprac - Randomize Questions

cmdprac has a question and answer array. The index for the question
array must match the answer array to get the correct answer.

### Problem
I need to randomize the question array so the questions are not always
asked in the same order but both array indexes must match.

### Ideas
Get the array length. Iterate between 0 and array max length and store
numbers in a new array. 0 and the max length must be included. Shuffle
the new array. Use the shuffled array for questions and answers.

### Thoughts
Ill give this a shot. I assume there is a better way to solve this
problem. Ill reach out to a few people who are well versed in bash.
I dont want the answer! Just ideas. I love figuring out problems!
So much fun.

    #cmdprac #bash #scripting
