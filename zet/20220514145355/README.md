# Learn by drilling

In jiu-jitsu drilling is essential for learning. Drilling involves doing
repetitions of the same move over and over. Your body learns the
movements and its burned into muscle memory. Over time you can preform
the move automatically without thinking. Like the legend Bruce Lee said
"I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the
man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times."

I think this is a great philosophy for learning as well. I often forget
commands or syntax and need to spend extra time looking them up. Going
forward I am going to incorporate this philosophy into me daily routine.
I'm going to start up daily drilling routine for essential commands and
syntax. For each day of the week I will have a theme. For example
Mondays could be Linux/UNIX system administration, Tuesdays could be
regex and so on. Ill brain storm ideas for each day.
